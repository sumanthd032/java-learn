/*
 * Multithreaded Programming: Synchronization
 *
 * Synchronization:
 * - Ensures that only one thread accesses a shared resource at a time, preventing race conditions.
 * - Achieved using:
 *   - Synchronized methods: `synchronized returnType methodName() { body }`
 *   - Synchronized blocks: `synchronized (object) { code }`
 * - Monitors (locks) are used to control access to synchronized code.
 *
 * This program demonstrates synchronization with a shared Counter class accessed by multiple threads.
 * - Without synchronization, the counterâ€™s value would be inconsistent due to concurrent modifications.
 * - With synchronization, updates are thread-safe.
 *
 * Package:
 * - In `com.learning.threads` to demonstrate package organization.
 *
 * Why It Matters:
 * - Synchronization is critical in multithreaded programs to ensure data integrity.
 *
 * Exercise:
 * 1. Remove the synchronized keyword and observe the inconsistent counter values.
 * 2. Use a synchronized block instead of a synchronized method in Counter.
 * 3. Create a new thread that decrements the counter and ensure synchronization.
